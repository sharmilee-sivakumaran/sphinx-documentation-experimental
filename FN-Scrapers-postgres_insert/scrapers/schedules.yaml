# According to the FAQ at https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/, the website
# is updated at 4 AM and 9 PM (presumably both CA time).
# The scraper is expected to take about 5 hours for each run. So, if it starts at
# 9:15 PM, it will finish, generally, by 2:15 AM. However, if it takes the full 7h 45m
# its allowed, it won't finish until 5 AM - past the 4:15 AM next start time. This
# isn't a big deal - the scraper should kick off immediately again, and, as long
# as it finishes by noon (7h 45m hours past 4:15 AM), we won't enter an ERROR state.
# NOTE: We add in the extra 15 minute delay to try to make sure the site actually
# has updated before we start scraping. We use the 7h 45m max_scheduler_duration so
# that we can say that we expect to be fully up-to-date by noon CA time (3 PM Eastern)
# since that is a nice, round number to report on for latency purposes.
